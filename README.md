# 433Dimmer_hacking

Hacking, sniffing and decoding the signal of the cheap Amazon/Ebay/AliExpress Remote Control LED dimmers.

This will contain my advances in hacking the remote, from capturing the signal, to creating my own receiver using an ESP32 which receives RF 433MHz and keeps sync of the status via WiFi. This page will be a summary of the findings. For each step there will be a log in folders for every area of developement with their advances.
