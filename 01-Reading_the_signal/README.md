Equipment used:
  - Raspberry Pi 3B
  - DSO Shell D150 Oscilloscope
  - HZL-A06-B (identical to XD-RF-5V)
  - Small Breadboard
  - 2x RF Remote controls

## 2024-07-11 Getting an idea of how the signals look like
The first thing to do is just Hook up the RF module to 5V and read the signal with the oscilloscope
